# Introduction to AI with Python — Assignments

This repository contains solutions to various assignments from the **Harvard CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python** course. Each folder corresponds to a different topic in Artificial Intelligence, covering fundamental AI concepts using Python.

## 📂 Contents

| Assignment      | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `degrees/`      | Implements a degree-of-separation algorithm to find connections between actors using breadth-first search. |
| `heredity/`     | Uses probabilistic inference to compute the likelihood of gene inheritance. |
| `knights/`      | Solves a logic puzzle involving a series of knights and knaves using model checking. |
| `minesweeper/`  | Builds an AI agent to play the Minesweeper game intelligently. |
| `pagerank/`     | Implements the PageRank algorithm to rank webpages based on incoming links. |
| `shopping/`     | Trains a machine learning model to predict whether users will make a purchase based on behavior data. |
| `tictactoe/`    | Builds a Tic Tac Toe AI using the Minimax algorithm. |
| `parser/`       | Parses sentences using context-free grammar and the NLTK chart parser. |
| `traffic/`      | Uses Markov Decision Processes to control traffic lights based on state transitions. |
| `attention/`    | Implements attention-based mechanisms for Natural Language Processing tasks. |
| `nim/`          | AI agent for the Nim game using Minimax with alpha-beta pruning. |
| `crossword/`    | Solves crossword puzzles with constraint satisfaction problems (CSP). |
